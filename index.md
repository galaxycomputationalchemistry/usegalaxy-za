# What is Galaxy ZA 
A platform based on the [Galaxy Project]() that is primarily aimed at providing computational chemistry tools and workflows. The service will be hosted on the [ilifu](http://www.ilifu.ac.za/) research cloud.

# What does it provide
Chemistry tools and workflows, [read the paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz107/5317160). Some of these tools are currently available on [Galaxy Europe](https://cheminformatics.usegalaxy.eu/)

# Availability & Registration
Estimated available from end of July 2019

## User eligibility
Academic users are most welcome, especially attendees of the BRIDGE workshop, users of the CHPC and any interested in workflows for computational chemistry modelling. 


## Data
(quota subject to change)
- Registered users will receive 1Gb of data. (Note registration will require approval)
- Trusted users will receive 20Gb and may request additional data. 
- Unregistered users will receive 1 byte of data.

### Privacy 
- Your data is yours and will be kept private. Anything you share to choose to share publically will be made public. 
- Statistics reflecting tool usage and time on the cluster will be collected. This data will be used to ensure fair resource sharing and anonymised for reporting to funders on usage statistics of tools. 

# Governance & reporting
The key contact at present is @chrisbarnettster who has raised the funding for resources on ilifu. 
Governance needs to be formally set up and should include individuals from eResearch UCT, the Scientific Computing Research Unit, the Galaxy Computational Chemistry Team,  SANBI and ilifu. 

# Funders & Timeline
This project has been funded for 3 years (with core funding) through the NRF Research Development Grants for Y-Rated Researchers and subsidised by NRF Incentivie funding for rated researchers. 
The major contribution to computer hardware was provided by an UCT ACC grant and this was used to contribute to the ilifu cloud. 

# Partners and Collaborations
This project has benefitted from several partnerships and collaborations.
- University of Cape Town
  - The Scientific Computing Research Unit. Prof Kevin Naidoo, Tharindu Senapathi (@tsenapathi), Chris Barnett (@chrisbarnettster)
